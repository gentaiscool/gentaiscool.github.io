I am a Senior Research Engineer at Bloomberg LP. Recently, I completed my Ph.D. at the Electronic and Computer Engineering Department and [Center for AI Research (CAiRE)](https://hltchkust.github.io/), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Previously, I finished my Bachelor in Computer Science at Institut Teknologi Bandung. I serve as a program committee and reviewer for various machine learning and natural language processing conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and AAAI, and journals.

My current research interests lie primarily in the area of the Natural Language Understanding, Multilingual, Cross-lingual, Code-Switching, Dialogue, and Speech.
